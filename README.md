# Project for CMSS
This repository contains the slides and code for our project in [Computational Modelling Social Systems](https://github.com/dgarcia-eu/ComputationalModellingSocialSystems) by [David Garcia](http://dgarcia.eu), 2022

# Model
We implemented the model introduced in [A STATISTICAL MODEL OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/M3AS-final.pdf) with the help of python and the [mesa framework](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

You can download the ipython file and execute it your own environment (jypyther, anaconda, etc.)

# Slides

The slides of our presentation are created with [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) and can be found [here](https://ohdearaugustin.github.io/CMSS/slides/slides.html)
