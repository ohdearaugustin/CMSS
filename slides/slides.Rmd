# Introduction: 'Burglary Model'

- Based on the paper [Short et. al. (2008): "A Statistical Model of Criminal Behavior" ](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/M3AS-final.pdf)
- Emergence, dynamics, and steady-state properties of crime hotspots
- Empirical observation: spatio-temporal clusters of crime
  - **Spatial correlations**: high crime rate in certain areas
  - **Temporal correlations**: repeated targeting
- Question: what drives the emergence of different burglary patterns that result in 'crime hotspots'?

# Theoretical Background

- "Broken Windows Theory", [Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/_atlantic_monthly-broken_windows.pdf)
- Crime is more likely to happen in areas, where it has already happend
- A broken window lowers the threshold to break more windows
- Criticism: biased observations, focus on symptoms rather than causes & negligence of systematic discrimination/disintegration

# Model Assumptions

The attractiveness of a house to be victimized is based on two assumptions:

- repeat and near-repeat victimization
- "Broken Windows Theory"

$$A_s(t) = A_s^0 + B_s(t)$$

---
# Model

- MultiGrid with size 50 x 50 (original 128 x 128)
- Uniform distribution of attractiveness
- Burglars tend to "walk" towards more attractive houses
-  Central Parameters
  - $\eta$ - Measures neighborhood effect [0 - 1]
  - $\theta$ - Dynamic increase of attractiveness
  - $\Gamma$ - Rate of burglar generation at each site

# Different Outcomes
## 1. Spatical homogeneity
## 2. Dynamic hotspots
## 3. Stationary hotspots

# 1. Spatical homogenity

# Resumee

- 


---
# Limitations

- No presence of police forces
- No model for the attractiveness of houses (all uniform)
  - Would be a villa more or less attractive?
- All burglars behave in the same manner
  - Are there different kinds of burglars in reality?
