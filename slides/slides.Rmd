# Introduction: 'Burglary Model'

- Based on the paper [Short et. al. (2008): "A Statistical Model of Criminal Behavior" ](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/M3AS-final.pdf)
- Emergence, dynamics, and steady-state properties of crime hotspots
- Empirical observation: spatio-temporal clusters of crime
  - **Spatial correlations**: high crime rate in certain areas
  - **Temporal correlations**: repeated targeting
- Question: what drives the emergence of different burglary patterns that result in 'crime hotspots'?

# Theoretical Background

- "Broken Windows Theory", [Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/pdf/_atlantic_monthly-broken_windows.pdf)
- Crime is more likely to occur in areas where it has already occurred
- A "broken window" lowers the threshold to break further windows
- Criticism: biased observations, focus on symptoms rather than causes & negligence of systematic discrimination/disintegration

# Model Assumptions: Agents
- 2 types of agents: Houses and Burglars
- The attractiveness of a **house** to be victimized is based on two assumptions:
  - Repeat and near-repeat victimization
  - "Broken Windows Theory"

$$A_s(t) = A_s^0 + B_s(t)$$
- **Burglars** decide at every step: break in vs. move on
- They tend to "walk" towards more attractive houses ("biased random walk")

# Model

- MultiGrid with size 50 x 50 (original 128 x 128)
-  Central Parameters
  - $\eta$ - Measures neighborhood effect [0 - 1]
  - $\theta$ - Dynamic increase of attractiveness
  - $\Gamma$ - Rate of burglar generation at each site

# Different Outcomes

# Resumee

- Model generates nonlinear feedback loops which originate patterns of aggregation
- Qualitative similarity to empirical observations of 'crime hotspots'
  - Better understanding of why and how hotspots form
  - Better understanding of underlying dynamics


---
# Limitations

- Negligence of barriers/hindrances
  - No presence of police forces
  - No security/surveillance infrastructure
- Spatially uniform value for static attractiveness
  - Would an expensive property be more or less attractive?
- Spatially uniform density of houses
- All burglars behave in the same manner
  - Different kinds of burglars in reality?
